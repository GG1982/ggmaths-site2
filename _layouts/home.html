        <div class="about-me__body flex-center body-width">
            <p>
                and I have been a full-time maths tutor for over six years and am devoted to teaching. I am passionate about
                maths and
                want to pass on my expertise to as many students as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                My love for it began while studying maths at The University of East Anglia. While there, I worked with a
                charity to help
                children from underprivileged backgrounds improve in their maths and English.
            </p>
            <p>
                Watching the growth and progress these
                children made was incredible and inspired me to pursue this as my job. I knew if I wanted to make the most
                impact on a
                student, it would be in a one-to-one setting. That's because I can change my style to fit the student's
                needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so, for the last six years, I have done that. In this time, I've helped students go from a grade 3 to a
                grade 7 in
                their GCSE's. I have helped A-Level students with their STEP and MAT entrance exams to Oxford or Cambridge.
                And I've
                helped students at 11+ get into grammar schools.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm extraordinarily proud of each of my students and go to the best of my ability to give them the support
                they're
                seeking.
